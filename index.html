  <h2>Wellington Rabbit Rescue:</h2>
  <p>Wellington Rabbit Rescue (WRR) is a not for profit group that takes on abused, neglected, sick, injured and unwanted rabbits. It was officially started by Chrissy Joy in August 2015 and we have seen well over 100 rabbits through the shelter already.</p>

  <h2>Rabbits in our care:</h2>
  <p>Our shelter is constantly full. We always have a waitlist of rabbits needing to come into our care. We have a limit of 20 rabbits in our care at one time. This number does fluctuate, depending how many urgent cases we receive.</p>
  <p>Once rabbits are brought into the care of WRR they receive any veterinary treatment they may require. We use a rabbit specialist vet to ensure they are in the best hands possible.</p>
  <p>All rabbits in our care are desexed and vaccinated. If any of the rabbits in our care are too young to be desexed they are sent home with a desex agreement which we follow up once the rabbit is old enough. </p>
  <p>We lead by example by housing the rabbits in our care in large enclosures  so they can exhibit natural rabbit behaviour as well as feeding them a high quality, natural diet.</p>
  <p>We have many wonderful foster homes where we can send rabbits until their forever home is found. This means the shelter is not over crowded and each rabbit gets the time and energy they deserve spent on them</p>

  <h2>Rehoming:</h2>
  <p>As rabbits are highly social creatures we rehome in pairs. If someone wanting to adopt has a single rabbit needing a friend we organise what has been affectionately called “speed dating” appointments. We mix the rabbits to ensure they are suitable for one another and then give their new family advice on rabbit bonding.</p>
  <p>We inspect any potential homes. We require the rabbits to be housed in a large area. They need to be able to run and jump. We also encourage new owners to include enrichment toys. Our minimum standard is an area 2 metres long, 1 metre wide, 1 metre high as well as a warm dry house at least 61x61cm. BUT we always encourage people to have a much larger area, preferably allowing their rabbits to be free range indoors or in a fully fenced backyard. We are firm believers that #ahutchisnotenough !</p>
  <p>All rabbits are sent home with a Wellington Rabbit Rescue care guide that has been approved of by two different rabbit specialist vets.</p>
  <p>Any rabbits that cannot be rehomed will remain in our care. We only resort to euthanasia in extreme cases such as very ill or severely injured rabbits. In this case we will have them humanely euthanized by our vet to prevent further suffering.</p>

  <h2>Education:</h2>
  <p>We do our best to educate the public on rabbit welfare. We use our Facebook page to spread important messages about rabbits in New Zealand. </p>
  <p>We also help run a group called Bunnies of Wellington. This group was formed by Nikki Cryer as a group for owners of rabbits in the Wellington Region to get together and socialize their rabbits (and with each other, ha)! It has developed into a great place for rabbit owners to also ask for basic advice, find bunny sitters etc. You can find this group here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/191898097849935/">Bunnies Of Wellington</a></p>
